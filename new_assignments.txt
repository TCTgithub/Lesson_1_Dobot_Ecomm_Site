1) Hover and create button with stripes 
diagonal 45 degrees
dark part is 01c2c3
outside border is 4dd9da
button background 01ccce
"every other diagonal"


2) make "transition" at .25 sec and stays until hover off

3) refactor the CSS
- order of elements/classes
- zeros
- short-hand extra declarations
- establish own way of ordering declarations - read about other ways
- ie abc, length (bad), inspector order ie how firebug, or how space is taken up
