- How important is it to use real git versus github user-friendly interface?
- use img for red "dobt" icon and blue "buy this" button? dobot icon and blue button become pixilated in zoom?
- Best file naming conventions practices? (style sheet selectors, project file names)
- px versus em sizing for images?
- downloaded new fonts, show up in system, but don't work in css?
- Does all content need to belong inside tags? Like, at very least inside <div> tags?
- Firefox won't read *.psd files...converted to *.png instead?
- Terminology issue: attribute vs. property...CSS selector + properties, HTML element + attributes? 
- Class v. id....just a matter of your own organization? If you use all ids, really disorganized but works? "A given element can have more than one class associated with it, while an element can only have one id. For example, you can give a div two classes whose styles will both take effect."
